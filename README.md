# Artisan-AI
Welcome to the official kickoff for our GenAI Exchange Hackathon project: "Artisan AI: A Marketplace for Local Creators."

Hey Team,

Welcome to the official kickoff for our GenAI Exchange Hackathon project: "Artisan AI: A Marketplace for Local Creators."

We have a fantastic opportunity to build something truly impactful, and we have until the first week of September to create a working prototype. The great news is we already have a mini frontend to build upon. My goal as team lead is to ensure we work smart, stay aligned, and have a great time bringing this idea to life.

Here is our roadmap. Let's read it, discuss it, and then start building!

Our Vision

We're not just building another e-commerce site. We're creating a platform that uses the power of Generative AI to:

    Tell Authentic Stories: Help artisans who aren't expert writers create compelling narratives for their products and profiles.

    Enhance Discovery: Allow buyers to find unique products through natural, descriptive language, not just keywords.

    Empower Creators: Simplify the process of listing products, so artisans can focus on their craft.

Team Roles & Primary Responsibilities

To ensure we move fast and efficiently, here are our defined roles. While we'll all collaborate, this defines primary ownership.

    Team Leader & Project Manager (Your Name): I will manage our project board (Trello/Jira), oversee the integration of all components, handle the final deployment, and prepare our presentation and demo video. I'm here to remove any roadblocks.

    Frontend Lead (Person with the mini-frontend): You will own the User Interface and Experience (UI/UX). Your mission is to expand the existing frontend, build out all necessary React components and pages, and ensure the platform is beautiful, intuitive, and fully responsive.

    Backend Lead: You are the architect of our server-side logic. You'll be responsible for setting up the server, designing the database schema, and building the REST APIs that our frontend will communicate with.

    AI/ML Lead: You will be the heart of our "GenAI" features. Your focus will be on mastering and integrating the Google Gemini API to power our core functionalities, starting with content generation and moving to semantic search.

    Full-Stack & Testing Lead: You are the vital link between all parts of our stack. You'll work closely with the Frontend and Backend leads to ensure seamless API integration and lead our quality assurance efforts by testing endpoints and user flows.

Proposed Tech Stack

Let's lock in our tools so we can hit the ground running.

    Frontend: React (or Next.js, based on the existing mini-frontend) with Tailwind CSS for styling.

    Backend: Node.js with Express.js for a fast and flexible server.

    Database: Firebase Firestore for its real-time capabilities and ease of use.

    AI Engine: Google Gemini API (This is key for the hackathon).

    Deployment: Vercel for the Frontend, Google Cloud Run for the Backend.

    Collaboration: GitHub for version control, Trello for task management, and Discord/Slack for communication.

Project Timeline: A 3-Week Sprint Plan

üóìÔ∏è Week 1 (Aug 18 - Aug 24): Foundation & Core Feature MVP

Goal: Build the skeleton of our application and get one core AI feature working as a proof-of-concept.

    Backend Lead:

        Set up Node.js/Express server.

        Design and implement Firestore database schema (Users, Artisans, Products).

        Build user authentication APIs (Sign Up, Login, Logout).

    Frontend Lead:

        Expand the existing UI to include key pages: Homepage, Product Detail Page, Login/Sign Up Page.

        Use placeholder/mock data to populate the UI for now.

    AI/ML Lead:

        Get API keys for the Gemini API.

        Key Task: Create a standalone script that takes a product title and a few keywords, and uses the Gemini API to generate a rich, story-driven product description. This is our first "wow" feature.

    Full-Stack Lead:

        Assist the Backend lead with API setup.

        Set up Postman/Insomnia to begin testing the authentication endpoints as they are built.

    Team Leader:

        Set up GitHub repo, Trello board with Week 1 tasks, and our Discord/Slack channel.

‚úÖ Milestone by Aug 24: A clickable frontend with mock data, a backend with working user authentication, and a successful demo of the AI product description generator script.

üóìÔ∏è Week 2 (Aug 25 - Aug 31): Integration & Feature Expansion

Goal: Connect all the pieces and build out the full user journey for an artisan.

    Backend Lead:

        Develop full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) APIs for products.

        Create endpoints for viewing and updating Artisan profiles.

    Frontend Lead:

        Connect the frontend to the live backend APIs. Replace all mock data.

        Build the "Add New Product" form and the "My Profile" page for artisans.

    AI/ML Lead:

        Work with Backend/Frontend to integrate the AI description generator directly into the "Add New Product" form.

        Key Task: Begin developing our second AI feature: AI-Powered Search. This involves using the Gemini API's embedding capabilities to turn product titles/descriptions into vectors, enabling natural language search (e.g., "show me rustic wooden bowls for a modern kitchen").

    Full-Stack Lead:

        This is your crunch week! You'll be the primary integrator, ensuring the data flows smoothly from the frontend form, through the backend API, to the database.

        Rigorously test all product and profile APIs.

‚úÖ Milestone by Aug 31: A user can create an account, upload a product with an AI-generated description, and see it displayed on the homepage. A basic version of the AI search is functional.

üóìÔ∏è Week 3 (Sep 1 - Sep 7): Polish, Deployment & Presentation Prep

Goal: Finalize the user experience, deploy the app, and prepare a winning presentation.

    All Members:

        Intensive testing and bug squashing. Add any issues found to the Trello board.

    Frontend Lead:

        Focus entirely on UI/UX polishing. Add subtle animations, loading states, and ensure the mobile experience is flawless.

    Backend & AI Leads:

        Address bugs, optimize database queries, and add any necessary data validation.

        Refine the prompts sent to the Gemini API for better and more consistent results.

    Full-Stack Lead:

        Conduct end-to-end testing of the entire user journey.

        Verify that the deployed application is working as expected.

    Team Leader:

        Deploy the frontend to Vercel and the backend to Google Cloud Run.

        Create the presentation deck and write the script for our 3-minute demo video. We will all contribute to recording the demo.

üèÜ Final Milestone by Sep 7: Our application is live! Our presentation is polished, our demo video is compelling, and our GitHub repository is clean and well-documented.

Let's schedule a quick 15-minute sync-up every day to ensure we're on track. I'm incredibly excited to build this with all of you. Let's make it happen!
